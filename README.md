# Rust C-layout
Implementing Nic Barker's Clay algorithm from scratch in Rust.

Currently very early on so a ton of features do not exist yet.
I am aware that there exists bindings for Rust but I am choosing to ignore that so I can actually make something for once.

Original project can be found here:
